<p>
This is a study on decision-making. Please turn off and refrain from using any electronic devices throughout today's study, including your cell phones. If you have a question, please raise your hand and a study leader will come to answer you in private.  

<p>
<b>Make-A-Wish</b> <br>
The choices you make in today's study will involve <b>Make-A-Wish Foundation</b>, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that organizes and funds “wishes” for children with life-threatening medical conditions.  On their <a href="http://wish.org" target="_blank"> website (http://wish.org) </a>, Make-A-Wish describes their activities as follows: “We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy [… ] Most wish requests fall into four major categories: <br>
<b>I wish to go:</b><br>
Some wish kids want to travel to their favorite theme park, while others want to visit an exotic beach, go on a cruise, see snow for the first time, or attend a major sporting event or concert.<br>
<b>I wish to be:</b><br>
Children search the depths of their imagination when they wish to be someone for a day— a firefighter, a police officer or a model.<br>
<b>I wish to meet:</b><br>
Many want to meet their favorite athlete, recording artist, television personality, movie star, politician or public figure.<br>
<b>I wish to have:</b><br>
Children often wish for a special gift, such as a computer, a tree house, a shopping spree or something that they have coveted for a long time.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Rounds</b> <br>
There will be {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds in this study.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Selected Round and Selected Participant</b><br>
In each round, you will make a decision by answering a question, which we describe below.   At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select one round (out of the {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds) and one participant (out of the participants in this study session).  We will call these the selected round and the selected participant, respectively.  The decision made by the selected participant in the selected round will be implemented for payment.   No other decisions, by non-selected participants or by the selected participant in non-selected rounds, will be implemented for payment.   However, since any one of your decisions may actually be the one that is selected and hence implemented for payment, you should make each decision carefully and seriously, as if it is the one that actually counts.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Decisions</b><br>
In each round, you will have to make the following decision: 
“How many minutes (X) would you like to stay and earn money for Make-A-Wish Foundation, when any money you earn will be directed towards helping children in [NAME OF CITY]?”
</p>

<p>
Your choice of X can be from 0 – 35 minutes, and will correspond to Make-A-Wish Foundation being given a particular amount of money (you will be told the exact amounts for each possible choice of X).  Across rounds, the above question will only change by naming different cities in Texas.   
</p>

<p>
Imagine you are the selected participant and you chose to stay Y minutes in the selected round.  Then:
You will stay in this room for an additional Y minutes at the end of the study. Even if Y = 35 minutes, you will still complete the study within the advertised time.  During this Y minutes,  you will NOT be allowed to participate in any other activity, such as using a cell phone, and instead must just quietly wait with your eyes open (you will not be allowed to nap, and the study leader will remind you if you try). </p>

<p>
Note that the longer you choose to stay in the selected round (i.e., the higher Y is), the more money Make-A-Wish Foundation will receive.   
For instance, if you choose Y = 3, then you will have to stay 3 minutes and Make-A-Wish Foundation will receive the corresponding donation.   Or, if you choose Y = 6 minutes, then you will have to stay 6 minutes and Make-A-Wish Foundation will receive the corresponding donation. 
</p>

<p><b> Additional Bonus Payments: </b> <br> 
In each round, after you make your effort decision, you will answer two further questions. You should answer each question carefully, as one of the two questions in one of the rounds will be selected at random, and you may earn a bonus payment for this question, depending on your answer.  Read on for more information about these two questions:
</p>

<b>State Belief on Others' Decisions</b><br>
In each round, on the same screen that you make your above decisions, you will also be asked your belief about others' decisions.   In particular, you will be asked: 
“What is the MEDIAN number of minutes YOU BELIEVE others (excluding you) will stay and earn money for Make-A-Wish Foundation, when any money one earns will be directed towards helping children in [NAME OF CITY]?”   
</p>

<p>
If you correctly state the median number of minutes that others (excluding you) chose in the randomly selected round and the computer chooses this question, then you will receive an ADDITIONAL bonus payment of {{Constants.bonus}}.   Thus, it is in your interest to carefully guess the median number of minutes that other people chose to the best of your ability.   Note that your own decision will NOT impact this median that you are trying to guess. 
</p>

<b>State Confidence in the Belief on Others' Decisions</b><br>
In each round, on the screen after you make your guess about <b>others'</b> median decision, you will also be asked about your confidence in this decision.   In particular, you will face a series of {{number}} choices of the following type: 
"Would you rather receive {{Constants.confidenceBonus}} <b>if</b> your guess of the median is within {{Constants.accuracy}} minute of the true median, or would you rather receive [$X] for sure?", where X will range from {{min}} to {{max}}. </p>

<p> The decisions you will face will be presented like in the following table: in this example table, the participant selected that for any amount of money smaller than $1.00, she would rather take the gamble that pays her {{Constants.confidenceBonus}} if she is close to the true median, but for more money she prefers having the money for sure.
</p>

<p>
For the randomly selected round, the computer will also randomly select one of the decisions you made and will implement it, if the computer chooses this question. That means, the computer will then randomly choose one of the rows and check what you have chosen for this row: if you have chosen the left hand side, we will pay you {{Constantsn.confidenceBonus}} if your guess is within {{Constants.accuracy}} minute of the true median of everyone else's commitment in the randomly selected round. If you have chosen the right hand side, we will pay you what it states on the right hand side of the row in question. </p>

</p>Because any one row of any one round could be selected to count, you should treat all rows and all rounds as if they counted. This also means that it is in your best interest to think carefully about what amount of money is worth as much to you as the chance to win {{Constants.confidenceBonus}} <b>if</b> your guess was close enough to the truth. Note: because we will ask you about <b>others'</b> median choice, you cannot influence your likelihood of winning extra money by your decision of how many minutes to commit.
</p>

<p> <b> Note: </b> only ONE of the two questions for ONE of the {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds will be selected and counted for payment! </p>

<p>
<b>Reminder:</b> The median represents the 50th percentile. That is, if you have a series of numbers and order them from the lowest to the highest, then the median is the number in the middle. For example, the median of {1,3,4,9,10} is 4.   
</p>

<p>
<b>Information on Others' Decisions</b><br>
During Round 1, you will not receive any information on participants' decisions.
</p>

{% if Constants.public %} 
<p>
During Rounds 2 to {{Constants.num_rounds}}, you will learn the <b>median amount</b> of time other participants in this room (excluding you) chose to stay in the previous round.  For instance, in Round 2, you will learn the median amount of time other participants in this room chose to stay in Round 1. Similarly, in Round 7, you will learn the median amount of time other participants in this room chose to stay in Round 6. Note that your own decisions will NOT impact this median that you are shown. 
</p>

<p>Recall that after you have made your decisions for all {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds, one round will be randomly selected.  Everyone will learn how long everyone else chose to stay in the selected round (in other words, not just the median or the choice of the selected participant, but the number of minutes chosen to stay by every person in this room for that round).  First, you will have to write how many minutes, from 0 – 35, you chose to stay on a nametag, and then place that nametag on a visible location on your shirt/jacket.  You will have to keep this nametag on for the duration of the study.   Second, the study leader will ask people to come up to the front of the room in groups according to how long they chose to stay (which corresponds to the number on their nametag), from 0 to 35 minutes.  That is, when directed, you will come up to the front of the room along with anyone else who chose to stay the same amount of time as you.   The study leader will order these groups into a line at the front of the room such that people who chose the least amount of time will be on the left and people who chose to stay the most amount of time will be on the right.  For instance, if you chose 0 minutes, then you would be in the first group called up to the front of the room and will stand to the left.   On the other hand, if you chose 35 minutes, then you would be in the last group called up to the front of the room and will stand on the right.  The study leader will check to make sure that you come up to the front of the room at the correct time. 
</p>

<p>
During Rounds 2 to {{Constants.num_rounds}}, you will learn the <b>median amount</b> of time other participants in this room (excluding you) chose to stay in the previous round.  For instance, in Round 2, you will learn the median amount of time other participants in this room chose to stay in Round 1. Similarly, in Round 7, you will learn the median amount of time other participants in this room chose to stay in Round 6. Note that your own decisions will NOT impact this median that you are shown.   Aside from this information on the median, you will NOT learn any information about how long others choose to stay. That is, all participants’ decisions will remain anonymous.
