<li>In each of {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds, you will decide how many minutes you want to volunteer to make money for Make-A-Wish Foundation to help children in a particular city in Texas.  You will also make your best guess concerning the median number of minutes the other subjects will choose to volunteer in that round and tell us how confident you are in this guess.
{% if Constants.public %}<li>At the start of every round after the first, you will be told the median number of minutes chosen by other subjects in the previous round.{% endif %}
<li>{% if Constants.public %}At the end of all 10 rounds, one round will be chosen at random.  Everyone will reveal the number of minutes they decided to stay in that round to everyone else, by wearing nametags with that information, and by lining up in the front of the room from lowest to highest number of minutes.{% else %}Everyone's decisions about how long they chose to stay will remain anonymous.{% endif %}
<li>One person will be chosen at random from the selected round, and their choice will be implemented: they will have to wait for the amount of time they indicated, and we will make the associated contribution to Make-A-Wish-Foundation.
<li> You will answer the following two types of questions and you will be paid according to one of them for one randomly selected round: 
<li> <ul>
	<li> You will guess what the median number of minutes for the other participants is and will receive a bonus of {{Constants.bonus}} if you are correct.
	<li> You will decide between an extra bonus of {{Constants.confidenceBonus}} if your guess is within {{Constants.accuracy}} minute of the true median and various (smaller) payments that you would receive for sure.
</ul> 
<li> One round will be chosen to count for the extra bonuses - in this round, one of your decisions will be chosen at random and implemented.
</ul>
